# playgrounds

This repository contains list of my playground repositories

## What are playgrounds?

They are my "hacking experiments", something that I quickly build in order to play with some technology. They are my therapeutic coding hobbies, where I can "forget normal projects constraints" without worring that someone has to maintain them.

## Why?

So that I can better understand some technology
